A librarian wants to manage the details of books in a library using JavaScript. The system should use only objects, not classes or nested objects. The librarian must be able to perform basic operations such as viewing, searching, and analyzing books in the inventory.

Create 5 book objects with the following properties:

title (string)

author (string)

isbn (string)

price (number)

Store these objects in an array called books.

Apply a 10% discount to each book where the original price is greater than ₹500.

Provide a menu-driven system using prompt() to:

View all books (with updated prices)

Search a book by title

Display the most expensive book

Show all books by a specific author

Count the number of books above a given price

Display the total inventory value

Exit the application
