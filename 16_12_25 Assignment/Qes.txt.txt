You are a teacher managing the attendance list for your classroom. You want to develop a simple JavaScript program to handle student names efficiently. 
The system should use an array of strings to store the names of students. You do not want to use objects or classes—just arrays and functions.

This tool will help you:

Add new students to the attendance list.

View the complete list of students.

Update a student’s name if there was a spelling mistake.

Remove a student from the list if they transferred out.

Search for a student to check if they are enrolled.

Count the total number of students.

Sort the student names alphabetically.

Optionally, clear the entire list for a new year.

Use functions and an array of strings. Do not use objects.

You must read input from the user.

Functions to Implement:
addStudent(name)

Adds the given student name to the list.

Prevent duplicate entries.

viewStudents()

Displays all student names.

updateStudent(oldName, newName)

Replaces an old name with a new one, if found.

deleteStudent(name)

Removes a student by name.

searchStudent(name)

Checks whether the name exists in the list.

countStudents()

Displays the total number of students.

sortStudents()

Displays the list sorted in ascending order.

clearAllStudents()

Empties the list entirely.
NOTE: Make it menu driven and read choices from user...

A bank wants to develop a simple system to manage account balances privately. The system should allow users to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance, but direct access to the balance variable must be restricted.

Create a function createAccount(initialBalance) that returns an object with the following methods:

deposit(amount)

withdraw(amount)

checkBalance()

The balance variable should not be accessible directly—only via these methods.

Use closures to retain the balance across function calls.

You are asked to build a counter factory where each counter is independent and remembers its own count.

Create a function createCounter() that returns an object with:

increment()

decrement()

reset()

getValue()

Each counter should have its own internal count that persists due to closure.

Test it by creating two counters and showing they maintain their own state.
