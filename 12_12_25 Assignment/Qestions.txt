QNO 1.

You are tasked with developing SmartCart, a smart grocery shopping assistant using JavaScript functions.
 This assistant will help users manage their cart, calculate total prices, check for healthy items, and suggest better alternatives.

You must implement the required features using different types of functions and related concepts in JavaScript.

1. Add Items to Cart
Write a function declaration named addToCart(cart, item) that adds a new item  to the shopping cart array and returns the updated cart.

2. Remove Items from Cart
Use a function expression named removeFromCart(cart, itemName) to remove an item from the cart based on its name and return the updated cart.

3. Check Healthy Items
Define an arrow function isHealthy(itemName) that checks whether the item is present in a predefined list of healthy items.

4. Calculate Total with Tax
Create a function calculateTotal(cart, taxRate = 0.05) that calculates the total cost of items in the cart including a default 5% tax.

5. Apply Discount
Write a function applyDiscount(total, discount = 0.1) that applies a discount to the total cost. The default discount is 10%.

6. Add Multiple Items
Implement a function addBulkItems(cart, ...items) that uses rest parameters to add multiple items to the cart in a single call.


QNo 2:-

You're developing TuneTrack, a smart music playlist manager that helps users manage their favorite tracks. Users can add or remove songs, check if songs are trending, calculate the total duration of songs, apply skip-time, and more. Implement each of the following features using appropriate JavaScript function types and concepts.

1. Add Song to Playlist
Write a function declaration named addToPlaylist(playlist, songName) that adds a song name (string) to the playlist array and returns the updated playlist.

2. Remove Song from Playlist
Use a function expression named removeFromPlaylist(playlist, songName) to remove a song by its name from the playlist and return the updated array.

3. Check Trending Songs
Define an arrow function isTrending(songName) that checks whether a given song is in a predefined list of trending songs.

4. Calculate Total Duration
Write a function calculateDuration(durations, speed = 1) that takes an array of song durations (in minutes) and returns the total time to listen, adjusted for playback speed (default is normal speed: 1x).

5. Add Multiple Songs
Create a function addBulkSongs(playlist, ...songs) using rest parameters to add multiple songs to the playlist at once and return the updated playlist.


QNO 3:

You're building GameScore, a tool to help gamers track their scores across different levels of a game. Users can add scores, remove them, calculate totals, apply bonuses, and compare scores—all using JavaScript functions.

Implement each feature using the specified function types and concepts.

1. Add Level Score
Write a function declaration named addScore(scores, newScore) that adds a new level score to the array and returns the updated score list.

2. Remove Specific Score
Write a function expression named removeScore(scores, scoreToRemove) that removes a specific score (if found) and returns the updated array.

3. Check if High Score
Define an arrow function isHighScore(score) that checks if a score is greater than or equal to a given threshold (e.g., 80).

4. Calculate Total Score
Create a function calculateTotalScore(scores) that returns the total sum of all scores in the array.

5. Apply Bonus to Each Score
Write a function applyBonus(scores, bonus = 5) that adds bonus points to every score using map() and returns a new array.

6. Add Multiple Scores at Once
Use a function addMultipleScores(scores, ...newScores) with rest parameters to add any number of scores at once to the existing list.

You are a teacher managing the attendance list for your classroom. You want to develop a simple JavaScript program to handle student names efficiently. 
The system should use an array of strings to store the names of students. You do not want to use objects or classes—just arrays and functions.

This tool will help you:

Add new students to the attendance list.

View the complete list of students.

Update a student’s name if there was a spelling mistake.

Remove a student from the list if they transferred out.

Search for a student to check if they are enrolled.

Count the total number of students.

Sort the student names alphabetically.

Optionally, clear the entire list for a new year.

Use functions and an array of strings. Do not use objects.

You must read input from the user.

Functions to Implement:
addStudent(name)

Adds the given student name to the list.

Prevent duplicate entries.

viewStudents()

Displays all student names.

updateStudent(oldName, newName)

Replaces an old name with a new one, if found.

deleteStudent(name)

Removes a student by name.

searchStudent(name)

Checks whether the name exists in the list.

countStudents()

Displays the total number of students.

sortStudents()

Displays the list sorted in ascending order.

clearAllStudents()

Empties the list entirely.
NOTE: Make it menu driven and read choices from user...


5.

A bank wants to develop a simple system to manage account balances privately. The system should allow users to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance, but direct access to the balance variable must be restricted.

Create a function createAccount(initialBalance) that returns an object with the following methods:

deposit(amount)

withdraw(amount)

checkBalance()

The balance variable should not be accessible directly—only via these methods.

Use closures to retain the balance across function calls.



6.


You are asked to build a counter factory where each counter is independent and remembers its own count.

Create a function createCounter() that returns an object with:

increment()

decrement()

reset()

getValue()

Each counter should have its own internal count that persists due to closure.

Test it by creating two counters and showing they maintain their own state.
